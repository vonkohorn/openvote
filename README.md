# openvote

The world needs an open source, auditable, private, secure, fast, expressive, free voting system!
Want to help?  

[OpenVote.US](http://openvote.us) is a demonstration of "[Approval Voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting)", a dramatically better voting system that is also simple.  Approval Voting works the same way as you are accustomed, except that you can vote for as many of the candidates as you want. As usual, most votes wins.  

This project pulls candidates from the Google Civic API (2012) to serve each US voter based on their address.  

The demonstration site is intended to show what election results might look like under a better voting system.  The goal of the project is to provide democracy with a new tool.

-- This project was implemented before blockchain, and (as of 2017) I'd love to see this connected to a blockchain ID service.  It could also serve an API to provide aggregated polling data to media outlets. --
